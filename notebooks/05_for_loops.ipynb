    "### Questions:\n",
    "- How can I perform the same actions on many different files?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.\n",
    "- Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop.\n",
    "- Explain the difference between a variable’s name and its value.\n",
    "- Explain why spaces and some punctuation characters shouldn’t be used in file names.\n",

The other way around **`$filename-original`** could be problematic, the shell may not be able to tell where the variable name ends.
