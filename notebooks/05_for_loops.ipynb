    "This notebook is based on a snapshot of [Episode 5](https://kmichali.github.io/SC-shell-novice/05-loop/index.html) of the [Unix Shell lesson](https://kmichali.github.io/SC-shell-novice/) from the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org). The original material has more detail.\n",

    "### Questions:\n",
    "- How can I perform the same actions on many different files?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.\n",
    "- Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop.\n",
    "- Explain the difference between a variable’s name and its value.\n",
    "- Explain why spaces and some punctuation characters shouldn’t be used in file names.\n",

    "Loops are a programming construct which allow us to repeat a command or set of commands for each item in a list. As such they are key to productivity improvements through automation. Similar to wildcards, using loops also reduces the amount of typing required (and hence reduces the number of typing mistakes).\n",

    "Suppose we have several hundred genome data files (e.g., basilisk.dat, minotaur.dat, and unicorn.dat). For this example, we’ll use the **`creatures`** directory which only has three example files, but the principles can be applied to many many more files at once.\n",
